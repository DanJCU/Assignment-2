<h1>CP1406 - 2017 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 4</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong> Danilo O. Balanza Jr, Soh Jin Ann Anne, Sahil Kaushik</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p> 
	This website’s purpose is to sell existing fish products, as well as new expansions’ products and services of a pet shop specialising in puppies, veterinary and classes for landscaping and koi pond setup. This will be done by promoting the products and services to a youth client base, soliciting them to place orders and sign up for classes.	
</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Maintainance of fish products sales as well as meeting of class registration quota.</p>

<p>All other advertising done other than the website will remain consistant for 3 months after its launch. Success is achieved when in those 3 months, sales remain constant or increase.</p>

<p>A minimum of 15 will be set for class registration quota, with registration for future classes open over the 3 months after site launch. Success is achieved when at the end of the 3 months, the class registration quota has been met for both landscaping and koi pond setup classes. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
	<p>Teens and young adults, from age 15 to 25.</p>
	<p>Though the site aims to cater to the general public, it will focus towards those who would be interested in owning pets or who are pet owners.</p>
	<p>This will be done by using a ‘friendly’ and cosy looking design, with appealing images of fish/animals in the background.</p>
